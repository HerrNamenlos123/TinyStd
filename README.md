# TinyStd
A C++20, single-header alternative standard library with zero external dependencies

## Disclaimer

This library is WIP, not actively but sporadically maintained and provides no guarantees whatsoever.

I only made it for myself with just the features I needed and I add them as necessary. Many implementations are incomplete and it is likely that most of what you need is still incomplete or missing. 

You are free to use it for whatever you like, however you like, according to the license.

## What is this?

This library is an alternative standard library for anyone who wants to create software from scratch, without relying on huge libraries with enormous compile time.

This project was directly inspired by Handmade Hero and came to live as a direct consequence.

If you share the Handmade mindset and you want to create bloat-free, fast software from scratch, and you want to work on a higher level than what C provides, then this library serves as your starting point.

### Selling points

- Single Header with ~1200 LOC
- No external dependencies
- No C++ headers
- Only few specific C headers are used
- Optimized for compile time
- Uses C++20 templates and operator overloading where sensible for safe usage
- No RAII
- No Exceptions
- Not a single call to malloc outside of your arena initialization
- Engineered for fast iteration times but not memory safety or fast execution (although the latter naturally emerged)
- Define TINYSTD_USE_CLAY for additional conversions for the Clay flexbox layout library

#### Compile time

This library is specifically optimized for compile time, which allows your app to automatically compile and hot-reload a shared library at runtime. This means hot-reloading your code is quasi instant.

Example:
```cpp
#define TINYSTD_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "TinyStd.hpp"

using namespace ts::literals;

int main()
{
  print("Hello World: {} + {} = {}", 1, 2.0, "3"_s);
  return 0;
}
```
On my current machine, using clang 19 on Linux, the above code compiles to an executable in `0.15s`. This includes access to all features: Arrays, Lists, Templated Formatting, etc.

For reference, the following code includes all C++ standard headers that provide the same features, and it already takes `0.74s` to compile and it's only going to get more.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <expected>
#include <format>
#include <optional>
#include <print>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
  std::print("Hello World: {} + {} = {}", 1, 2.0, "3");
  return 0;
}
```

### Features

- Purely Arenas for memory management
- Length-Based Strings with `""_s`-literals and methods/operators for manipulation
- Type-safe string formatting (fmt::format/std::format), supporting python-like formatting and custom formatters for your classes
- print function (like printf/std::print but with type based formatting)
- Panic handler
- Optionals
- Result type (Rust/std::expected)
- Lists and Arrays with iterators (for-each)
- Pairs

## Requirements

A C++20 compiler is required.

## Usage

To use this library, simply copy `TinyStd.hpp` into your codebase and include it. Done!

You need one single implementation file, which will contain all the implementations and platform specific code:
```cpp
// TinyStd_impl.cpp
#define TINYSTD_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "TinyStd.hpp"
```

Add this somewhere in your codebase, exactly once.

If you have some sort of build system with a shared module, place it there. To improve compile time, place the implementation site somewhere it is only compiled once.

## Example usage

Arenas:
```cpp
using ts::Arena;

// Stack Arena (NO malloc)
StackArena<1024> arena; // 1024 bytes on stack

// Heap Arena
Arena arena = Arena::create(); // 1 malloc here
arena.free(); // calls free
arena.clearAndReinit(); // Free all chunks except first and clear it (faster than free + create, no malloc)

// Usage
int* value = arena.allocate<int>();
float* floatList = arena.allocate<float>(5);
App* app = arena.allocate<App>();
```

You are encouraged to create one large global Application struct and pass a pointer to it in every single function, 
and inside that would be one global arena or multiple per-frame arenas, etc.

That way you always have access to an arena and pass it to the functions that require it.

Strings:
```cpp
using ts::String;
using ts::format;
using ts::print;
using namespace ts::literals;

void foo() {
    auto arena = Arena::create(); // 1 malloc here

    auto str = "Hello World"_s;
    String result = format(arena, "{}\n{} + {} = {}", str, 1, 2, 3);
    print("The result is {}", result);

    arena.free();
}
```

Lists:
```cpp
using ts::String;
using ts::List;
using ts::Array;
using ts::print;

void foo() {
    auto arena = Arena::create(); // 1 malloc here

    List<int> numbers;
    numbers.push(arena, 187);
    numbers.push(arena, 42);
    numbers.push(arena, 69);

    print("Length: {}", numbers.length);
    for (auto& n : numbers) {
        print("n = {}", n);
    }

    Array<float, 3> array;
    array[0] = 1;
    array[1] = 2;
    array[2] = 3;

    print("Length: {}", array.length);
    for (auto& n : array) {
        print("n = {}", n);
    }

    arena.free();
}
```
